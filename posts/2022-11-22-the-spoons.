# It's Only The 'Spoons, How Risky Can It Be?
[https://www.social-engineer.org/social-engineering/qr-codes-and-captcha-tests-new-scams-in-a-digital-age/](https://www.social-engineer.org/social-engineering/qr-codes-and-captcha-tests-new-scams-in-a-digital-age/)

It’s only the ‘spoons, how risky can it be?

In these days of table service in pubs it is increasingly common to see QR code stickers with an invitation to scan to identify at which table you are seated. 
Just think about that for a second, you are scanning a code that can access and initiate activity in the apps on your phone. 
You don’t know who put that sticker there, they’re usually in pretty poor condition and, as long as they match the legitimate format, how would the staff notice?

Scanning this QR code **may** populate the table number in the pub’s app, 
it may instead connect you to a website imitating that app in order to harvest credit card details. 
It could initiate a download of malware, send texts or emails, perhaps even call your mum.

In short, don’t use them - if that doesn’t work for you there’s plenty of good advice in an article on
