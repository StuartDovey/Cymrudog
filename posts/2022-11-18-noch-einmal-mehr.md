# Define Yourself By What You Are For, Not What You Are Against

You’ve got to accentuate the positive…

Once upon a time we used to define ourselves by the things that we believed in, the things that we loved, the things that made us happy. If you asked someone about themself you’d have expected a response along the lines of “I’m a swimmer”, “I’m a trainspotter”, “I’m a scout leader” or painter, or rambler or into am-dram etc. etc. It’s a positive way to see yourself and your place in the world and, crucially, it leaves you open to relationships with, and understanding of, others who don’t necessarily share your world view, but do share your world.

In recent years, driven in no small part by **********every********** media source, people have been conditioned into defining themselves by what they oppose, what they are against, what they hate. It’s a very profitable business model for news media and social media platforms, but a very damaging one for everyone who lives on this planet.

When we define ourselves by that which we hate, it allows for no compromise, no consorting with the enemy, no quarter for those who don’t fit into the narrow confines of our own self definition. It leads to ruptured families, broken politics and an erosion of society that hurts everyone.

Don’t get me wrong, there are many things that I disagree with, that I oppose, some even that I hate, however I refuse to allow them to become part of me, become who I am. That which you hate should always be external to you otherwise that which you are **is** hate.

Please today just spend 2 minutes thinking of something that you love and that you would like people to think of when they think of you.

In the meantime.

You’ve got to spread joy up to the maximum…
