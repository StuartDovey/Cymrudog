# Positivity in unlikely situations

I just wanted to share a little bit about positivity in unlikely situations. For my birthday in 2019 I received an unwanted gift - a diagnosis of tonsillar cancer. From that moment on I was swept up by the system and in the space of a few short weeks I had had my tonsils removed along with a deep excavation of the tissues in the affected area, some teeth removed, a PEG tube inserted through my abdomen into my stomach, hearing tests and a full plan for radical chemo-radiotherapy to commence a couple of weeks later.

Not the happiest time, perhaps - well, oddly enough, this was the most positive experience of my life and has changed me for the better in many ways. Although I spent months undergoing chemo and daily radiotherapy, taking endless combinations of pills in an attempt to find the right balance; although there were days when I hiccupped for hours on end or had a 5 hour spell of vomiting that left my larynx and lips so badly burnt by stomach acid that I couldn't talk; and although I lost all sense of taste which left food so unappetising that at one point I was struggling to get 300 calories a day into me. All of this was just the noise against a background of warmth, compassion and love. 


This was the most positive time of my life because from start to finish I was surrounded by the most wonderful, caring and loving people, the nurses, volunteers, doctors, radiographers and especially the nutritionist, Lauren, who I called the cake lady for her attempts to get my weight back up.

All of these people treated me so kindly and with such empathy and concern, even while the whole nightmare of the pandemic was emerging around us, that I can't look back upon that time as anything other than a demonstration of how people can be so wonderful towards others and those memories are some of the fondest and most beautiful ones I have.

The only downside to the whole thing in my recollection is that when I was first diagnosed I told all my work colleagues that I would be taking 6 months off for treatment while they would still have to work. Then came the pandemic and all those lucky sods got time off too - typical.
